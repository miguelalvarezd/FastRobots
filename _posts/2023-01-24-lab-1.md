The objective of Lab 1 is to set up the Artemis board, test different programs, and become familiar with the bluetooth connection and commands.

## PART 1

### Prelab

The prelab for Part 1 consists on installing the Arduino IDE, as well as the Artemis board support software. After installing it, we can proceed to the Part 1 tasks.

### Tasks
After installing the necessary software, the next tasks involve testing different components of the board, with the code from different examples built in with the IDE.

#### 1. LED Blink
The purpose of this first task is to learn how to connect the Artemis board to the computer. If everything works properly, a blue LED will turn ON for 1 second, and then turn OFF for another seconds, as shown in the following video.

#### 2. Serial Input/Output

This program tests the Serial Monitor. First, the Artemis board will display a count from 0 to 9. After that, the monitor will display everything that gets typed in, as shown in the video.

#### 3. Analog reading - Temperature sensor
This section tests the temperature sensor of the Artemis. When heat is applied to the chip, the temperature recorded increases, as can be seen on the second column of the results displayed in the serial monitor. The opposite happens when the chip is cooled.

#### 4. Microphone test
Last but not least, the board can determine the frequency of the sound thanks to an integrated microphone. I used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-iCZElJ8m0" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> that sweeps across a wide range of frequencies. The Artemis board is able to determine frequencies from approximately 90Hz all the way up to 20kHz (the highest frequency of the video), according to my test.

### Conclusion
After connecting the Artemis to the computer, testing various of its components, and ensuring that they work, we can proceed to the next part, where we will connect the Artemis to the computer via Bluetooth (BLE). With BLE we will be able to send commands and receive data from the Artemis wirelessly.
