The objective of Lab 1 is to set up the Artemis board, test different programs, and become familiar with the bluetooth connection and commands.

## PART 1

### Prelab

The prelab for Part 1 consists on installing the Arduino IDE, as well as the Artemis board support software. After installing it, we can proceed to the Part 1 tasks.

### Tasks
After installing the necessary software, the next tasks involve testing different components of the board, with the code from different examples built in with the IDE.

#### 1. LED blink
In this test, a blue LED turns ON for 1 second, and then turns OFF for another second, as shown in the following video.

#### 2. Serial Input/Output

This program test the Serial Monitor. First, the Artemis board will display a count from 0 to 9. After that, the monitor will display everything that gets typed in, as shown in the video.

#### 3. Analog reading - Temperature sensor
This section tests the temperature sensor of the Artemis. When heat is applied to the chip, the temperature recorded increases, as can be seen on the second column. The opposite happens when the chip is cooled.

#### 4. Microphone test
Last but not least, the board can determine the frequency of the sound thanks to an integrated microphone. I used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-iCZElJ8m0">YouTube</a> video that sweeps across a wide range of frequencies. The Artemis board is able to determine frequencies from approximately 90Hz all the way up to 20kHz (the highest frequency of the video), according to my test.
