The objective of Lab 1 is to set up the Artemis board, test different programs, and become familiar with the bluetooth connection and commands.

## PART 1

### Prelab

The prelab for Part 1 consists on installing the Arduino IDE, as well as the Artemis board support software. After installing it, we can proceed to the Part 1 tasks.

### Tasks
After installing the necessary software, the next tasks involve testing different components of the board, with the code from different examples built in with the IDE.

#### 1. LED Blink
The purpose of this first task is to learn how to connect the Artemis board to the computer. If everything works properly, a blue LED will turn ON for 1 second, and then turn OFF for another seconds, as shown in the following video.

#### 2. Serial Input/Output

This program tests the Serial Monitor. First, the Artemis board will display a count from 0 to 9. After that, the monitor will display everything that gets typed in, as shown in the video.

#### 3. Analog reading - Temperature sensor
This section tests the temperature sensor of the Artemis. When heat is applied to the chip, the temperature recorded increases, as can be seen on the second column of the results displayed in the serial monitor. The opposite happens when the chip is cooled.

#### 4. Microphone test
Last but not least, the board can determine the frequency of the sound thanks to an integrated microphone. I used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-iCZElJ8m0" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> that sweeps across a wide range of frequencies. The Artemis board is able to determine frequencies from approximately 90Hz all the way up to 20kHz (the highest frequency of the video), according to my test.

### Conclusion
After connecting the Artemis to the computer, testing various of its components, and ensuring that they work, we can proceed to the next part, where we will connect the Artemis to the computer via Bluetooth (BLE). With BLE we will be able to send commands and receive data from the Artemis wirelessly.

## PART 2

### Prelab

The prelab for Part 2 consists of setting up the computer and the Artemis in order to be able to receive and send data through BLE; as well as installing Python and Jupyter notebooks, which will be used to communicate with the board. This Prelab also requieres us to familiarize with the basics of the BLE protocol, and some basic function calls.

#### 1. Installation of Python and the virtual environment

In order to communicate via BLE with the Artemis, we will use Python (in particular, Jupyter notebooks will be used to write the code). Additionally, we need to create a virtual environment for this project, in order to isolate it from the rest of the computer OS. I already had Python and pip installed, but I needed to update the former to the latest version (Python 3.12.1). This can be done through the <a href="hhttps://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python website</a>. 
After this process is finished, we need to set up the virtual environment. First, venv has to be installed:
```
py -m pip install --user virtualenv
```
Next, we need to create the virtual environment inside the project directory:
```
py -m venv FastRobots_ble
```
The virtual environment can be activated using the following command inside the project directory:
```
source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate
```
To desactivate it, we just need to run `deactivate`. With the virtual environment active, the last step in the setup is to install the necessary Python packages, including Jupyter, with the following command:
```
pip install numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio bleak jupyterlab
```
Now, the setup is finished. Whenever we want to run our code, we will need to activate the virtual environment, and then start Jupyter notebooks by running:
```
jupyter lab
```
