The objective of Lab 2 is to learn how to use the IMU; sampling data from the Accelerometer and from the Gyroscope.

### Prelab

The prelab for Lab 2 consists on reading through the data sheet of the IMU.

### Tasks

#### 1. IMU Set Up
To setup the IMU we need to install the SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout - ICM 20948 - Arduino Library. After that, we will run the Example 1, Basics, from the library examples. The value `AD0_VAL` represents the last bit of the I2C address. As the jumper in my IMU is closed, its value should be set to `0`. Additionally, to indicate that the board is running, I will add a small loop that blinks the LED 3 times.
```
pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);

for(int i=0; i<3; i++){
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  	// turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
    delay(1000);                      	// wait for a second
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   	// turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
    delay(1000);						// wait for another second
```

In the video below we can see that the IMU is recording data from the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. The accelerometer displays the acceleration in the three axis in mg (mili-g), while the gyroscope displays the angular velocity in the three axis in degrees per second.

#### 2. Accelerometer

We want to convert the accelerometer data into pitch and roll. To do this, I created a new command that recorded  400 data points from the accelerometer and converted each of the into pitch and roll. After recording the data, the Artemis sends those 400 points of pitch and roll, as well as their corresponding time stamp.
```
pitch_a = atan2(myICM.accX(), myICM.accZ())*180/M_PI;
roll_a = atan2(myICM.accY(), myICM.accZ())*180/M_PI;
```
I first tested the roll. The output at both ends is not +/-90ยบ, but -88.5 and 88.3. Therefore, I will add to the calculations a 90/88.5 conversion factor, so that real 90ยบ correspond to 90ยบ measurements. I repeated the same test for the pitch. This time, the output at both ends was 88.6 and -87.87; so the conversion factor added is 90/88.6.

The FFT shows some noise in the higher frequencies. However, it is not too large. This is because the IMU has a Low Pass Filter already implemented, according to the datasheet. Nevertheless, I will use a Low Pass Filter, following the equations from the class slides. The same equations are used to filter the roll. With a sample rate of approximately 0.007 and a cut-off frequency of around 3Hz or 4Hz, we obtain that alpha is 0.14.
```
pitch_a_LPF[n] = alpha*pitch_a + (1-alpha)*pitch_a_LPF[n-1];
pitch_a_LPF[n-1] = pitch_a_LPF[n];
```
Even though there's already a LPF in the chip, we can see that by applying a LPF the noise is reduced considerably.

#### 3. Gyroscope
The gyroscope can also be used to obtain pitch and roll, as well as yaw. We can use the following equations, where we integrate the data recorded (which is angular velocity) to obtain angles.
```
pitch_g = pitch_g + myICM.gyrX()*dt;
roll_g = roll_g - myICM.gyrY()*dt;
yaw_g = yaw_g + myICM.gyrZ()*dt;
```
If we compare the results with those from the acceleromter, we can notice that they have less noise, but are susceptible to drift; this is, the signal increases even though the IMU is in a still position.

Using a complimentary filter can help us get more accurate results. This filter takes into account both the results from the accelerometer and the gyroscope, getting rid of noise and drift.
```
pitch = (pitch+myICM.gyrX()*dt)*(1-alpha_cf) + pitch_a*alpha_cf;
roll = (roll+myICM.gyrY()*dt)*(1-alpha_cf) + roll_a*alpha_cf;
```
We can see the results in this comparison, where we display pitch and roll from the accelerometer, with LPF, from the gyroscope, and from the complimentary filter.

#### 4. Data Sampling
The board can also determine the frequency of the sound thanks to a microphone. I used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-iCZElJ8m0" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> that sweeps across a wide range of frequencies. The Artemis board is able to determine frequencies from 90Hz  to 20kHz.

#### 5. Stunts
The board can also determine the frequency of the sound thanks to a microphone. I used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-iCZElJ8m0" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> that sweeps across a wide range of frequencies. The Artemis board is able to determine frequencies from 90Hz  to 20kHz.

### Conclusion
After ensuring that everything works well, can proceed to the next part, where we will connect the Artemis to the computer via Bluetooth. With BLE we will be able to send commands and receive data from the Artemis wirelessly.
