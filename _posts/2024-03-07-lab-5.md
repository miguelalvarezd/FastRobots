The objective of Lab 5 is to develop a PID controller so that the robot runs towards a wall and stops at 1ft.

### Prelab

As part of this Prelab, we have to setup a debugging system with Python and Bluetooth. First, I will create a command, `PID_TEST`, that will run the Position Control code, while storing data for debugging. It will stop when the data arrays are full. The size of these arrays can be changed with a macro.

The `PID_TEST` command will receive 5 arguments: whether I want to use extrapolation or not, the Set Point to the wall, Kp, Ki and Kd. Being able to change these parameters quickly over Bluetooth will help us later when tuning the PID controller.

**Python command:**
```
ble.send_command(CMD.PID_TEST,"1|305|0.1|0|0") #This means: use extrapolation, setPoint=305mm, Kp=0.1, Ki=Kd=0
```

**Arduino code:**
```
case PID_TEST:{
  //Collect all the arguments
  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.extrapolation);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.setPoint);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.Kp);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.Ki);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.Kd);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  //Enable ranging in the TOF sensor
  distanceSensorA.startRanging();

  /*
    Initialize all necessary variables...
  */

  //Start the test
  pid.run_test = true;

  Serial.println("Test started.");
  break;
}
```
```
void loop(){
  if (central) {
    /*
      ...
    */
    
    while (central.connected()) {
      /*
        ...
      */

      if(pid.run_test){ //&& ((millis()- pid.start_time) <= 5000)){
        /*
          PID controller code...
        */

        //Store variables used to debug
        pid.distance[pid.i] = pid.curr_distance;
        pid.time[pid.i] = pid.curr_time;
        pid.pid_val[pid.i] = pid.pid;
        pid.pid_error[pid.i] = pid.error;
        pid.i++;
          
        //If I run out of space, end test
        if(pid.i >= N_PID){
          pid.run_test = false;
          pid.pid = 0;
          brake();
          Serial.println("Test ended. Brake");
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The second command is `SEND_DATA_PID`, which will tell the Artemis to send all its stored debugging data to the computer. In Python, there's a notification handler that parses all the data.

**Python command:**
```
ble.send_command(CMD.SEND_DATA_PID,"")
```

**Notification handler:**
```
def notification_handler_5(uuid, byte_array):
  global string
  string = ble.bytearray_to_string(byte_array)

  stringData.append(string)

  time=string.split("|",4)[0]
  distance=string.split("|",4)[1]
  pid=string.split("|",4)[2]
  error = string.split("|",4)[3]

  timeData.append(float(time)/1000)
  distanceData.append(float(distance))
  pidData.append(float(pid))
  errorData.append(float(error))
```

**Arduino code:**
```
case SEND_DATA_PID:{
  Serial.print("Sending data...\n");
  pid.send_data = true;
  pid.i = 0;
  break;
}
```

```
void loop(){
  if (central) {
    /*
      ...
    */
    
    while (central.connected()) {
      /*
        ...
      */

      if(pid.send_data){
        if(pid.i < N_PID){
          tx_estring_value.clear();
          tx_estring_value.append(pid.time[pid.i]);
          tx_estring_value.append("|");
          tx_estring_value.append(pid.distance[pid.i]);
          tx_estring_value.append("|");
          tx_estring_value.append(pid.pid_val[pid.i]);
          tx_estring_value.append("|");
          tx_estring_value.append(pid.pid_error[pid.i]);
          tx_characteristic_string.writeValue(tx_estring_value.c_str());
          pid.i++;
        }else{
          pid.send_data = false;
          Serial.println("Data sent.");
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
      
```

### Tasks

#### 1. P/I/D Controller Type
The PID controller has three terms:

- The Proportional control is just a proportional gain over the error. 
- The Integral control remembers previous errors so that we can achieve 0 error. 
- The Derivative control determines future errors to anticipate and get quicker to the desired state.

To determine the type of controller, I will run a test with a simple P controller. I run a test with Kp = 0.05. We can see that the robot oscillates around 0 error when it reaches the end. This means that we need a derivative control to eliminate those oscillations and make changes to the PID quicker. However, an integral control is not needed, as the error we get is already 0.

#### 2. Ranging Time and Extrapolation

In the previous test, the updates to the PID controller were only done when a new TOF reading was available. The sensor is slow: the sampling rate is approximately 100ms. We can improve it in two ways:

- First, if there's no new data from the sensor, use the old one, but still update the PID controller. The results are exactly the same as before. However, the sampling rate is now roughly 7ms.

- Second, when there's no data, we will estimate it with a simple extrapolation, based on the previous two distance points. The sampling rate remains almost the same at 9ms; but now we have new values of distance every cycle. 

We can implement the extrapolation as follows:

```
//Obtain time data
pid.curr_time = millis();
        
//Obtain distance data or estimate
if(distanceSensorA.checkForDataReady()){
  pid.curr_distance = distanceSensorA.getDistance();
  distanceSensorA.clearInterrupt();
          
  if(!pid.first_reading){
    pid.first_reading = true;
  }else{
    pid.slope = (pid.curr_distance - pid.prev_distance)/(pid.curr_time - pid.last_reading_time);
  }
          
  pid.last_reading_time = pid.curr_time;
  pid.prev_distance = pid.curr_distance;
}else{
  if(pid.extrapolation && pid.first_reading){
    pid.curr_distance = pid.prev_distance + pid.slope*(pid.curr_time - pid.last_reading_time);
  }
}
```

We can see that now we have more reliable distance data, that updates every cycle.

#### 3. PID Tuning

With the extrapolation, the frequency of the system is around 100Hz. I will implement a Low Pass Filter in the derivative action to get rid of any possible noise (as we can see in the second figure) above 100Hz. We don't have to worry about derivative kick as the SetPoint is constant.
Last, I will tune my PD controller using the 2nd Heuristic method from lecture.

The results are shown here:
**1. Kp = 0.1; Kd = 0.0**
**2. Kp = 0.025; Kd = 0.01 (no LPF)**
**3. Kp = 0.025; Kd = 0.01 (with LPF)**
**1. Kp = 0.1; Kd = 0.0**
**1. Kp = 0.1; Kd = 0.0**
Kp  Kd
0.1 0
0.025  0.01
0.025  



*Note: As in Lab 4, some videos have a cable connected to the robot. This is because powering the Artemis from a battery doen't work. New batteries have been tested, so the problem is possibly related to the voltage regulator of the Artemis. In future labs I will test a different board. This didn't have any major impacts in the robot behaviour for this lab.*
