The objective of Lab 6 is to develop a PID controller so that the robot mantains a certain angle, defined as a SetPoint.

### Prelab

There is no prelab for this lab. However, as a reference, I will use the same debugging system as explained in <a href="https://miguelalvarezd.github.io/FastRobots/lab-5/#:~:text=Prelab,the%20PID%20controller." target="_blank">Lab 5</a>. In this lab no extrapolation is needed. In some instances, that input will be useless. In others, I will use that first argument to test the maximum rotational speed that the IMU can read, as explained later. The SetPoint, Kp, Ki and Kd are still set the same way as the previous lab.

### Tasks

#### 1. Input Signal: Gyroscope Reading

The purpose of this lab is to maintain a certain orientation of the robot. To measure the orientation, we are going to use the gyroscope inside the IMU. As shown in <a href="https://miguelalvarezd.github.io/FastRobots/lab-4/#:~:text=Then%2C%20I%20hooked%20up%20every%20component%20to%20the%20chasis" target="_blank">Lab 4</a>, the IMU is flat in the robot, so by reading the Z measure from the IMU we can obtain the yaw. However, the IMU measures angular speed (in dps), so we need to integrate it to obtain degrees. Additionally, I will use the function ```remainder()``` to limit the angles to <span>&#177;</span> 180ยบ. Note that the units of dt are milliseconds (as I use millis()); but we need to use seconds when obtaining the yaw, as the units of the angular speed are degree per second.

```
//Read angular speed
ori.ang_speed = myICM.gyrZ();
          
//Obtain dt, yaw and limit angles to +-180 degrees
ori.dt = ori.curr_time - ori.last_time;

ori.raw_yaw = ori.yaw + ori.ang_speed*ori.dt/1000;
ori.yaw = remainder(ori.raw_yaw, 360);
```

The initial results show that the angle measurement is not completely accurate. This is because the gyroscope has a limit on the maximum angular speed it can read. Fortunately, we can change it with ```setFullScale()``` and the variable ```myFSS.g```. Its value will be dps followed by a number, which corresponds to the limit on the maximum angular speed. By default, it is set in dps250. 

```
myFSS.g = dps1000; // (ICM_20948_GYRO_CONFIG_1_FS_SEL_e). Can be dps250, dps500, dps1000, or dps2000
    
myICM.setFullScale(ICM_20948_Internal_Gyr, myFSS);
```

I will run a test with a very fast (and not optimal) Proportional controller with Kp=4 to try to reach the maximum angular speed that the motors can provide, and record that data. We can see that the speed is capped in both dps250 and dps500; but it doesn't get past 1000dps. Therefore, I will set the maximum angular speed to 1000dps.

#### 2. P/I/D Controller Type

As in <a href="https://miguelalvarezd.github.io/FastRobots/lab-5/#:~:text=The%20PID%20controller%20has,to%20the%20desired%20state." target="_blank">Lab 5</a>, there are three terms in the PID controller. To determine the type of controller, I will run a test with a simple P controller. I run a test with Kp = 0.05. We can see that the robot oscillates around 0 error when it reaches the end. This means that we need a derivative control to eliminate those oscillations and make changes to the PID quicker. However, an integral control is not needed, as the error we get is already 0.

#### 3. Controller Implementation

##### A. Derivative Term

The variable we are working with, the yaw, is the integration of another varible, the angular speed. However, the derivative term takes into account not only the measurement, but also the SetPoint (we derive the error, which is SetPoint minus Measurement). The SetPoint will mostly be constant, so its derivative is 0; except when we change it, that will be infinite. As I want to account for this cases, instead of using the angular speed, I will obtain the derivative of the error, and limit it to $\pm$ 100. In cases where dt is 0, which leads to infinite values for the derivative, I will consider the previous derivative value.

A low pass filter is not needed because: a) the IMU already had one implemented; and b) the control variable is the integration of another one.

```
//Obtain derivative term
if(ori.dt==0){
  ori.derivative = ori.prev_derivative;
}else{
  ori.derivative = (ori.error - ori.prev_error)/ori.dt;
}

//Wind-up for derivative kick
if(ori.derivative > 100){
  ori.derivative = 100;
}else if(ori.derivative < -100){
  ori.derivative = -100;
}

// Update previous derivative for next iteration
ori.prev_derivative = ori.derivative;
```



#### 4. ....

Even though I'm not using integral action, I will implement it for future ocassions (and now set Ki to 0). My controlling variable is ```pid.pid```, which is also the value I input to the motor. The PID value can be between 0 and 1, meaning that some movement is still required. As the motor only accepts integers, I will round up those values to 1. Then, I will set the speed with the function created in Lab 4, which converts inputs so that an input of 1 is the value of the deadband, and 100 corresponds to 255.

```
//If the PID is less than 1, but not 0, round up to 1, as the PWM only accepts integers
if(abs(pid.pid) < 1 && abs(pid.pid) > 0){
  if(pid.pid > 0){
    setSpeed(1, 1);
  }else{
    setSpeed(-1, -1);
  }
}else{
  setSpeed(pid.pid, pid.pid);
}
```

Additionally, as the maximum speed input is 100, I will limit the PID value to +-100.


```
//Limit the PID to a certain speed (#define MAX_PID 100 previously)
if(pid.pid > MAX_PID){
  pid.pid = MAX_PID;
}else if(pid.pid < -MAX_PID){
  pid.pid = -MAX_PID;
}

```

I will define the error so that if we are further than the Set Point, the pid input to the motor will be positive and the robot will go forwards. I will also consider small errors (less than 5mm) equivalent to 0.

```
//Obtain error and dt
pid.error = pid.curr_distance - pid.setPoint; 
pid.dt = pid.curr_time - pid.last_time;

//If error is too small, make it 0. It is an acceptable position
if(abs(pid.error) <= 5){
  pid.error = 0;
  pid.last_n_error_0++;     //This variable is used for extrapolation. Explained later
}else{
  pid.last_n_error_0 = 0;
}
```

Now, once we have a distance reading or estimation (explained in the next part), we should update the pid value. 
First, let's implement the derivative term. As will be explained later, we need a Low Pass Filter to get rid of noise above 100Hz. However, we shouldn't worry about derivative kick. Additionally, I will discard calculations of the derivative term when dt=0, as it will produce an infinite value.

```
//Apply Low Pass Filter and avoid dt=0 (infinite values for derivative)
if(pid.dt==0){
  pid.derivative = pid.prev_derivative;
}else{
  pid.raw_derivative = (pid.error - pid.prev_error)/pid.dt;
  pid.derivative_1 = pid.alpha*pid.raw_derivative;
  pid.derivative_2 = (1-pid.alpha)*pid.raw_derivative;
  pid.derivative = pid.derivative_1 + pid.derivative_2;   //I implemented the filter in two steps so that the Artemis runs it properly.
                                                          //Otherwise it runs in some problems.
}

// Update previous derivative for next iteration
pid.prev_derivative = pid.derivative;
```

Now, we should implement the integration term. As this term increases over time, I will implement a wind-up so that it doesn't get above certain values.

```
if(pid.integral > 1000){
  pid.integral = 1000;
}else if(pid.integral < -1000){
  pid.integral = -1000;
}

pid.integral = pid.integral + pid.error*pid.dt;
```

Last, we need to update the value of the pid, with the values of Kp, Ki and Kd from Bluetooth and other terms from calculations.

```
//Obtain PID controller value
pid.pid = pid.Kp*pid.error + pid.Ki*pid.integral + pid.Kd*pid.derivative;

//Update parameters for future calculations
pid.prev_error = pid.error;
pid.last_time = pid.curr_time;
```

The code that will run the test is the following.

```
if(pid.run_test){

  /*
    Estimate or obtain distance...
  */

  /*
    Update PID...
  */
          
  /*
    Record debugging data...
  */
}
```


#### 4. Programming Implementation

In the previous test, the updates to the PID controller were only done when a new TOF reading was available. The sensor is slow: the sampling rate is approximately 100ms. We can improve it in two ways:

- First, if there's no new data from the sensor, use the old one, but still update the PID controller. The results are exactly the same as before. However, the sampling rate is now roughly 7ms.

- Second, when there's no data, we will estimate it with a simple extrapolation, based on the previous two distance points. The sampling rate remains almost the same at 9ms; but now we have new values of distance every cycle. In my implementation, I won't estimate any distance until the first sensor reading is obtained. Additionally, if the last 5 iterations indicated 0 error, I won't estimate any new distance, as a way of filtering out possible random noise in the sensor.

We can implement the extrapolation as follows:

```
//Obtain current time
pid.curr_time = millis();
        
//Obtain distance data or estimate
if(distanceSensorA.checkForDataReady()){
  pid.curr_distance = distanceSensorA.getDistance();
  distanceSensorA.clearInterrupt();
          
  if(!pid.first_reading){
    pid.first_reading = true;
  }else{
    pid.slope = (pid.curr_distance - pid.prev_distance)/(pid.curr_time - pid.last_reading_time);
  }
          
  pid.last_reading_time = pid.curr_time;
  pid.prev_distance = pid.curr_distance;
}else{
  if(pid.extrapolation && pid.first_reading){
    if(pid.last_n_error_0 >= 5){
      pid.curr_distance = pid.prev_distance;
    }else{
      pid.curr_distance = pid.prev_distance + pid.slope*(pid.curr_time - pid.last_reading_time);
    }
  }
}
```

We can see that now we have more reliable distance data, that updates every cycle.

#### 5. PID Tuning

With the extrapolation, the frequency of the system is around 100Hz. I will implement a Low Pass Filter in the derivative action to get rid of any possible noise (as we can see in the second figure) above 100Hz. We don't have to worry about derivative kick as the SetPoint is constant.
Last, I will tune my PD controller using the 2nd Heuristic method from lecture (Increase Kp until oscillation, reduce, increase Kd until oscilation, reduce, iterate).

The results are shown here:

**1. Kp = 0.1; Kd = 0.0**

<img class= "img_post" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab5/test1.png" alt="Test 1.">

**2. Kp = 0.025; Kd = 0.01 (no LPF)**

<img class= "img_post" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab5/test2.png" alt="Test 2.">

**3. Kp = 0.025; Kd = 0.01 (with LPF)**

<img class= "img_post" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab5/test3.png" alt="Test 3.">

After some testing I arrived at the following values:

**4. Kp = 0.07; Kd = 0.15**
