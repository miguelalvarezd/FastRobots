The objective of Lab 1 is to set up the Artemis board, test different programs, and become familiar with the Bluetooth connection.

### Prelab

The prelab for Lab 2 consists on reading through the data sheet of the IMU.

### Tasks
Now, we will test different components of the board, with examples from the IDE.

#### 1. IMU Set Up
The purpose of this task is to learn how to connect the Artemis board to the computer. A blue LED will turn ON for 1 second, and then turn OFF for another seconds.

#### 2. Accelerometer

The first thing we need to do is to convert the accelerometer data into pitch and roll. To do this, I created a new command that recorded  400 data points from the accelerometer and converted each of the into pitch and roll. After recording the data, the Artemis sends those 400 points of pitch and roll, as well as their corresponding time stamp.
```
pitch_a = atan2(myICM.accX(), myICM.accZ())*180/M_PI;
roll_a = atan2(myICM.accY(), myICM.accZ())*180/M_PI;
```
I first tested the roll. The output at both ends is not +/-90ยบ, but -88.5 and 88.3. Therefore, I will add to the calculations a 90/88.5 conversion factor, so that real 90ยบ correspond to 90ยบ measurements.

I repeated the same test for the pitch. This time, the output at both ends was 88.6 and -87.87; so the conversion factor added is 90/88.6

The FFT shows some noise in the higher frequencies. To fix that, I will use a Low Pass Filter, following the equations from the class slides.
```

```
To obtain alpha, we use the formula alpha = T/(T+RC); where T=1/sample_rate=aprox 0.05; and RC=1/(2_PI_fc). The cutoff frequency is approx 1Hz, so alpha = 0.24.

#### 3. Gyroscope
This section tests the temperature sensor of the Artemis. When heat is applied to the chip, the temperature recorded increases, as can be seen on the second column of the results. The opposite happens when the chip is cooled.

#### 4. Data Sampling
The board can also determine the frequency of the sound thanks to a microphone. I used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-iCZElJ8m0" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> that sweeps across a wide range of frequencies. The Artemis board is able to determine frequencies from 90Hz  to 20kHz.

### Conclusion
After ensuring that everything works well, can proceed to the next part, where we will connect the Artemis to the computer via Bluetooth. With BLE we will be able to send commands and receive data from the Artemis wirelessly.
