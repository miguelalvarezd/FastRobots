The objective of Lab 5 is to develop a PID controller so that the robot runs towards a wall and stops at 1ft.

### Prelab

As part of this Prelab, we have to setup a debugging system. I will do this with Python and Bluetooth. First, I will create a command, `PID_TEST`, that will run the Position Control code, while storing certain data for debugging. It will stop when the data arrays are full. I decided to implement the test this way, instead of a specific ammount of time, becasue I wanted to control the size of the arrays. Very big arrays will take more time to send to the computer, so for initial testings I may want smaller arrays (and shorter tests). This size can easily be changed with a macro.

The `PID_TEST` command will receive 5 arguments: whether I want to use extrapolation or not, the Set Point to the wall, Kp, Ki and Kd. Being able to change this parameters quickly over Bluetooth will help us later when tuning the PID controller.

**Python command:**
```
ble.send_command(CMD.PID_TEST,"1|305|0.1|0|0") #This means: use extrapolation, setPoint=305mm, Kp=0.1, Ki=Kd=0
```

**Arduino code:**
```
case PID_TEST:{
  //Collect all the arguments
  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.extrapolation);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.setPoint);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.Kp);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.Ki);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  success = robot_cmd.get_next_value(pid.Kd);
  if(!success){
    return;
  }

  //Enable ranging in the TOF sensor
  distanceSensorA.startRanging();

  /*
    Initialize all necessary variables...
  */

  //Start the test
  pid.run_test = true;

  Serial.println("Test started.");
  break;
}
```
```
void loop(){
  if (central) {
    /*
      ...
    */
    
    while (central.connected()) {
      /*
        ...
      */

      if(pid.run_test){ //&& ((millis()- pid.start_time) <= 5000)){
        /*
          PID controller code...
        */

        //Store variables used to debug
        pid.distance[pid.i] = pid.curr_distance;
        pid.time[pid.i] = pid.curr_time;
        pid.pid_val[pid.i] = pid.pid;
        pid.pid_error[pid.i] = pid.error;
        pid.i++;
          
        //If I run out of space, end test
        if(pid.i >= N_PID){
          pid.run_test = false;
          pid.pid = 0;
          brake();
          Serial.println("Test ended. Brake");
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The second command is `SEND_DATA_PID`, which will tell the Artemis to send all its stored debugging data to the computer. In Python, there's a notification handler that parses all the data.

**Python command:**
```
ble.send_command(CMD.SEND_DATA_PID,"")
```

**Notification handler:**
```
def notification_handler_5(uuid, byte_array):
  global string
  string = ble.bytearray_to_string(byte_array)

  stringData.append(string)

  time=string.split("|",4)[0]
  distance=string.split("|",4)[1]
  pid=string.split("|",4)[2]
  error = string.split("|",4)[3]

  timeData.append(float(time)/1000)
  distanceData.append(float(distance))
  pidData.append(float(pid))
  errorData.append(float(error))
```

**Arduino code:**
```
case SEND_DATA_PID:{
  Serial.print("Sending data...\n");
  pid.send_data = true;
  pid.i = 0;
  break;
}
```

```
void loop(){
  if (central) {
    /*
      ...
    */
    
    while (central.connected()) {
      /*
        ...
      */

      if(pid.send_data){
        if(pid.i < N_PID){
          tx_estring_value.clear();
          tx_estring_value.append(pid.time[pid.i]);
          tx_estring_value.append("|");
          tx_estring_value.append(pid.distance[pid.i]);
          tx_estring_value.append("|");
          tx_estring_value.append(pid.pid_val[pid.i]);
          tx_estring_value.append("|");
          tx_estring_value.append(pid.pid_error[pid.i]);
          tx_characteristic_string.writeValue(tx_estring_value.c_str());
          pid.i++;
        }else{
          pid.send_data = false;
          Serial.println("Data sent.");
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
      
```

### Tasks

#### 1. P/I/D Controller Type
The PID controller is meant to change the inputs of a system so that we can get to a desired state. Its calculations are based on the error (desired state vs current one). The Proportional control is just a proportional gain over the error. The Integral control remembers previous errors so that we can achieve 0 error. The Derivative control determines future errors to anticipate and get quicker to the desired state.

Therefore, to determine the type of controller I will first run a test with a simple P controller. If the final error is not 0, I will need a PI controller; while if it is too slow, I will need a PD controller (or PID in case of both).




#### 2. PID Tuning

Now that we know the type of controller we want, I will tune it using the Xst Heuristic method from lecture.

The results are shown here:

#### 3. Range Time and Extrapolation

Up until now, the updates to the PID controller were done only when a new TOF reading was available. The sensor is slow: the sampling rate is ms. We can improve it in two ways:

- First, if there's no new data from the sensor, use the old one, but still update the PID controller. The results are exactly the same as before. However, the sampling rate now is ms.

- Second, when there's no data, we will estimate it with a simple extrapolation, based on the previous two distance points. The sampling rate remains at ms; but now we have new values of distance every cycle. We can implement this as follows:

```
pid.curr_time = millis();
pid.dt = pid.curr_time - pid.last_time;

//Obtain distance if ready data ready or estimate
if(distanceSensorA.checkForDataReady()){
  pid.curr_distance = distanceSensorA.getDistance();
  distanceSensorA.clearInterrupt();

  if(!pid.first_reading){
    pid.first_reading = true;
    pid.prev_distance = pid.curr_distance;
  }
}else{
  if(pid.extrapolation && pid.first_reading){
    pid.curr_distance = pid.prev_distance + pid.slope*pid.dt;
  }
}

/*
  PID Controller code...
*/

//Slope update
pid.slope = (pid.curr_distance - pid.prev_distance)/pid.dt;
pid.prev_distance = pid.curr_distance;
```

This extrapolation, however, doesn't seem to work with our system. Any discrepancy between the estimation and the sensor reading will end up in a very big slope for the next reading, meaning that the next estimation will be even larger. This will keep increaing the value of the estimation; which results on an overflow of the variables, and the controller won't work.
A fix to this is to reduce by 1000 the value of the slope, so that the increment in distance is smaller. However, this yields almost the same result as no extrapolation, so I won't use it moving on.
Possible future fixes to consider might include the use of a filter, or use some heuristicts to modify the slope depending on its value, or the type of reading (estimation or real reading from the sensor).



*Note: As you may have noticed, as in Lab 4, some videos have a cable connected to the robot. This is because powering the Artemis from a battery doen't work. New batteries have been tested, so the problem is possibly related to the voltage regulator of the Artemis. In future labs I will test a different board, and I will probably have to resolder a new one. This didn't have any major impacts in the robot behaviour for this lab.*
