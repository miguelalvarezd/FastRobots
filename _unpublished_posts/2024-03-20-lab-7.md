The objective of Lab 7 is to develop a Kalman Filter for our robot, and simulate in Python.

### Prelab

There is no prelab for this lab.

### Tasks

#### 1. Drag and Momentum Estimation  89673.000

The Kalman Filter needs a system model to work, given by the A and B matrices. These matrices are built with the drag and mass of the car, so we need to estimate those parameters. To do so, we perform a speed test, where the car moves forward towards a wall, and we record the distance and time stamps. The goal is that the car reaches a steady state speed, from which we can estimate the drag and mass. However, the ToF sensor only has a 4m range, so distances above that value are inaccurate. To ensure that we reach steady state, the car will run for an arbitrary amount of time, and then it will start recording data. When it gets to 0.5m to the wall, it will stop. The arbitrary waiting time, and the input to the motor is set with Bluetooth (`id.wait_time` and `id.pid`, respectively).

```
if(id.run_test){

  //Obtain time data
  id.curr_time = millis();
        
  //Obtain distance data
  if(distanceSensorA.checkForDataReady()){
    id.curr_distance = distanceSensorA.getDistance();
    distanceSensorA.clearInterrupt();

    id.data_ready = true;
  }else{
    id.data_ready = false;
  }

  //Obtain error and dt
  id.error = id.curr_distance - id.setPoint;
  
  id.dt = id.curr_time - id.last_time;    
  id.last_time = id.curr_time;
        
  //Update values to debug if data ready, and waiting time ended
  if(id.data_ready && ((id.curr_time - id.start_time) > id.wait_time)){
    /*
     *  Update values to send via Bluetooth
     */
    id.i++;
  }
          
  //If I run out of space, end test
  if(id.i >= N_ID){
    /*
     *  Stop Test
     */
  }

  //If I get too close to the wall, end test
  if((id.error <= 5) && (id.i >= 1)){
    /*
     *  Stop Test
     */
  }

  setSpeed(id.pid, id.pid);
}
```

After trial and error, I obtained the following data, with a motor input of **u=80%**:

Considering only the steady state section:
<img class= "img_post" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab7/speed_test.png" alt="Speed Test.">

We find out that the steady state speed is **3050mm/s**. The 90% value of this speed is 2745mm/s, corresponding to a time stamp of 428.343s. The test started at 425.933s, so the 90% rise time is **2.41s**.


#### 2. Kalman Filter Initialization

The next step is to initialize the Kalman Filter. First, we have to compute the A and B matrices, given by:

$$
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 
0 & 1\\
0 & -d/m
\end{array}\right)=
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 
10 & 0\\ 
0 & 5
\end{array}\right)
$$ 

#### 3. Controller Implementation

##### A. Derivative Term

The yaw is the integration of the angular speed. However, the derivative term takes into account not only the measurement, but also the SetPoint (we derive the error, which is SetPoint - Measurement). The SetPoint will mostly be constant, so its derivative is 0; except when we change it, that will be infinite. As I want to account for this cases, instead of using the angular speed, I will obtain the derivative of the error, and limit it to <span>&#177;</span>100. In cases where dt is 0, which leads to infinite values for the derivative, I will consider the previous derivative value.

A low pass filter is not needed because: a) the IMU already had one implemented; and b) the control variable is the integration of another one.

```
//Obtain derivative term
if(ori.dt==0){
  ori.derivative = ori.prev_derivative;
}else{
  ori.derivative = (ori.error - ori.prev_error)/ori.dt;
}

//Wind-up for derivative kick
if(ori.derivative > 100){
  ori.derivative = 100;
}else if(ori.derivative < -100){
  ori.derivative = -100;
}

// Update previous derivative for next iteration
ori.prev_derivative = ori.derivative;
```

##### B. Integration Term

Integration is implemented for future labs. After it, I include a wind-up of <span>&#177;</span>100 so that this term doesn't increase to infinity in case we are far from the SetPoint.

```
//Obtain integration term
ori.integral = ori.integral + ori.error*ori.dt;

//Wind-up for integration part
if(ori.integral > 100){
  ori.integral = 100;
}else if(ori.integral < -100){
  ori.integral = -100;
}
```

##### C. Rest of the Controller

The remaining code for the controller is almost the same as in <a href="https://miguelalvarezd.github.io/FastRobots/lab-5/#:~:text=2.%20Controller%20Implementation" target="_blank">Lab 5</a>: the PID value is obtained with Kp, Ki and Kd; and is limited to a maximum value (in this case, <span>&#177;</span>100). The 'previous' variables are udpdated for future iterations, and we also save variables to send them later via Bluetooth and debug the system; while stopping the test when they are full. 

The only aspects that differ are:

<ul> <li>The error, which is obtained as SetPoint - Yaw. If the error is very small I will consider it 0. This way of calculating the error means that, if the robot has turned some degrees clockwise, the yaw will be negative, so the error positive. The robot will havee to turn anti-clockwise, so the right motor goes forward, and the left one backwards.</li></ul>

```
//Obtain error
ori.error = ori.setPoint - ori.yaw;

//If error is too small, make it 0. It is an acceptable position
if(abs(ori.error) <= 2){
  ori.error = 0;
}
```

<ul> <li>The speed we set to the motor. In this case, following the error sign convention, the right motor will receive the positive value of the PID, while the left one will receive the negative value. Again, if the PID is small but not 0, round up the value to 1.</li></ul>

```
//If the PID is less than 1, but not 0, round up to 1, as the PWM only accepts integers
if(abs(ori.pid) < 1 && abs(ori.pid) > 0){
  if(ori.pid > 0){
    setSpeed(1, -1);
  }else{
    setSpeed(-1, 1);
  }
}else{
  setSpeed(ori.pid, -ori.pid);
}
```

The general structure of the controller is the same as in <a href="https://miguelalvarezd.github.io/FastRobots/lab-5/#:~:text=The%20code%20that,Record%20debugging%20data...%0A%20%20*/%0A%7D" target="_blank">Lab 5</a>.


#### 4. PID Tuning

I will tune my PD controller using the 2nd Heuristic method from lecture. The results are shown here (the first steps of tunnig were done in Part 2):

**1. Kp = 2; Kd = 0.1**

We still get oscillations

<img class= "img_post" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab6/test1.png" alt="Test 1.">

**2. Kp = 1; Kd = 0.1**

No oscillations, but slower.

<img class= "img_post" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab6/test2.png" alt="Test 2.">

**3. Kp = 1.5; Kd = 0.4**

Much faster, and only a few oscillations

<img class= "img_post" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab6/test3.png" alt="Test 3.">

After some testing I arrived at the following values:

**4. Kp = 1.65; Kd = 0.87**

<img class= "img_post" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/lab6/test4.png" alt="Test 4.">

We can see the results here:
